# SIT737-2025-Prac5P â€“ Dockerized Calculator Microservice

## Overview

This project is a Dockerized calculator microservice built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Winston** logging. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, modulo, and square root through RESTful API endpoints.

---

##  Features

- REST API for basic arithmetic operations
- Logging of incoming requests and outgoing responses using Winston
- Dockerized using a custom Dockerfile
- Health checks using Docker Compose
- Automatic container restart on failure
- Logs persisted using volume binding

---

##  Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Winston Logger
- Docker
- Docker Compose
